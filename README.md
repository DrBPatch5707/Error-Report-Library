 – This is my FIRST library –

I know that this is nothing special, but I feel that this is a good first library.

I am very new to software, and I'm only on my second introduction to programing class.

I would appreciate any constructive criticsm.

The purpous of this library is to provide consistent documentation for errors through out a project.

  I will try to update the library whenever I have any improvements.
